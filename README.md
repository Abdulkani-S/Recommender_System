# Recommendation system using enhanced collaborative filtering

This project is a movie recommendation engine that uses both content based and collaborative filtering techniques to build a hybrid system that produces better results to the user. We built a special function to enhance the performance of the collaborating filtering technique to make it more effective in recommending new movies which are not rated by many users which is the base requirement for collaborative filtering.

Our function assigns temporary ratings to new movies so that it can be considered while using collaborative filtering to recommend movies to users.

Our function is specifically designed for the collaborative filtering technique that we used in our code which uses k nearest neighbours algorithm.

I'll add links to the original code for collaborative filtering and an explanatory article below.
